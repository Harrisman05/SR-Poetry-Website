Colin the cockney cowboy,\nFast asleep in his bed,\nDreaming of making movies,\nTrailered in his head.\n\nRows of Saturday morning heroes,\nCome alive all as one,\nEnergy being created,\nGot them on the run.\n\nTop gunslinger Ringo,\nHolstered left and right,\nUltra-whitened Stetson,\nActing the big gunfight.\n\nOutlaw notorious,\nOn the imaginary horse,\nFollowed by the local boys,\nThe ready to enforce.\n\nGunsmoke a swirling,\nA bellyful of lead,\nLaying horizontal,\nReleasing from the dead.\n\n“I want to play Geronimo”,\nBravest of the brave,\nAvoiding invisible bullets,\nTo dodge an early grave.\n\n“Circle the cardboard boxes”,\nDirector ten years old,\nThey died with their boots on,\nAs he had foretold.\n\n“Colin, I’ve called you once already,\nYour tea is getting cold.”\n
