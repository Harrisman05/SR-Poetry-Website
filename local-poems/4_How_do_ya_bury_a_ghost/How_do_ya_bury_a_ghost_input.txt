How do ya bury a ghost?
Whose sole intent,
Is to keep you awake,
As it missed the boat heaven sent.

Into the night,
Removed from the light,
Eternally hovering out of sight.

It’ll make you jump,
At the slightest sound,
Letting you know it’s still around.

Acknowledged by the living,
As spirit it struggles through,
Doesn’t realise there’s no body,
As it tries to contact you.

How do ya bury a ghost?
Always the unwanted host,
Opens kitchen cupboard doors,
Glides silently across your wooden
floors.

When all is still and quiet,
A pin drops in that tranquil,
A thud in another room,
A book on the floor at half past noon,
Hands on the clock will stop very soon.

Title: Lost And Never Found,
Old red leather and gold leaf bound,
So how do ya bury a ghost?
Stuck in the middle for far too long.

In need of help to see it gone,
It's never found its peace,
Before your time's up and you must go,
Try and help it to release.

How do ya bury a ghost?
Not in the flames of a pyre,
To burn and roast,
Not at sea with a wreath,
That hugs the jagged coast.

Point it to the stars in the universe,
Guide it on its way,
Released from its landlocked curse,
Never knowing it couldn’t stay,
On God’s sacred earth.

After all is said and done,
Even a fool knows,
Ya can't bury a ghost…
