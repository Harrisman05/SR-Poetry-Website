How do ya bury a ghost?\nWhose sole intent,\nIs to keep you awake,\nAs it missed the boat heaven sent.\n\nInto the night,\nRemoved from the light,\nEternally hovering out of sight.\n\nIt’ll make you jump,\nAt the slightest sound,\nLetting you know it’s still around.\n\nAcknowledged by the living,\nAs spirit it struggles through,\nDoesn’t realise there’s no body,\nAs it tries to contact you.\n\nHow do ya bury a ghost?\nAlways the unwanted host,\nOpens kitchen cupboard doors,\nGlides silently across your wooden\nfloors.\n\nWhen all is still and quiet,\nA pin drops in that tranquil,\nA thud in another room,\nA book on the floor at half past noon,\nHands on the clock will stop very soon.\n\nTitle: Lost And Never Found,\nOld red leather and gold leaf bound,\nSo how do ya bury a ghost?\nStuck in the middle for far too long.\n\nIn need of help to see it gone,\nIt's never found its peace,\nBefore your time's up and you must go,\nTry and help it to release.\n\nHow do ya bury a ghost?\nNot in the flames of a pyre,\nTo burn and roast,\nNot at sea with a wreath,\nThat hugs the jagged coast.\n\nPoint it to the stars in the universe,\nGuide it on its way,\nReleased from its landlocked curse,\nNever knowing it couldn’t stay,\nOn God’s sacred earth.\n\nAfter all is said and done,\nEven a fool knows,\nYa can't bury a ghost…\n
