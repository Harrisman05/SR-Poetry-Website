Well, me name is Séamus,\nI could be famous,\nBut I’m so shameless,\nCouldn’t care less if I tried.\n\nNow you don’t know it,\nA clandestine poet,\nBut I don’t show it,\nI bide my time.\n\nNot a sleeper,\nMore of a creeper,\nLike a grim reaper,\nI hang around.\n\nA storyteller,\nA rovin’ fella,\nA wordsmith seller,\nI ply my trade.\n\nNow I could teach ya,\nSome say a preacher,\nCould be a feature,\nThe show goes on.\n\nThe words of wander,\nThat comes from yonder,\nI’ll tear asunder,\nThat’s how I roll.\n\nCommunication,\nA slow rendition\nAlliteration,\nI spread the word.\n\nForever careering,\nAnd overhearing,\nBut never leering,\nTo catch a thought.\n\nPlagiarising,\nAnd super sizing,\nAdd a twist of lying,\nTo suit my needs.\n\nNever sighing,\nThe words are flying,\nI’m always trying,\nTo bend your ears.\n\nThe handy phrases,\nI put on pages,\nAll the sages,\nHave done before.\n\nI feel a phoney,\nAll this baloney,\nFor your eyes only,\nAh, what the hell,\nI’ve had a go!
