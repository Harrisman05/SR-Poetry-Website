Well, me name is Séamus,
I could be famous,
But I’m so shameless,
Couldn’t care less if I tried.

Now you don’t know it,
A clandestine poet,
But I don’t show it,
I bide my time.

Not a sleeper,
More of a creeper,
Like a grim reaper,
I hang around.

A storyteller,
A rovin’ fella,
A wordsmith seller,
I ply my trade.

Now I could teach ya,
Some say a preacher,
Could be a feature,
The show goes on.

The words of wander,
That comes from yonder,
I’ll tear asunder,
That’s how I roll.

Communication,
A slow rendition
Alliteration,
I spread the word.

Forever careering,
And overhearing,
But never leering,
To catch a thought.

Plagiarising,
And super sizing,
Add a twist of lying,
To suit my needs.

Never sighing,
The words are flying,
I’m always trying,
To bend your ears.

The handy phrases,
I put on pages,
All the sages,
Have done before.

I feel a phoney,
All this baloney,
For your eyes only,
Ah, what the hell,
I’ve had a go!
