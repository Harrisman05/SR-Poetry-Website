Her name is Mary,\nShe’s light and airy,\nNever contrary,\nShe’s good as gold.\n\nWithin her powers,\nTo nurture flowers,\nBetween the showers,\nMary ploughs on through.\n\nThe park around her,\nWould make your heart stir,\nA feral cat purr,\nShe loves her job.\n\nHer independence,\nAnd perseverance,\nMakes a difference,\nThe parks a joy.\n\nShe’s very sprightly,\nShe treads so lightly,\nThe grounds look mighty,\nShe’s number one.\n\nSo connected,\nTo the flowers selected,\nNothing neglected,\nOn top of her game.\n\nShe works her magic,\nWith rake and long pick,\nRarely off sick,\nCompletes the job.\n\nThe open spaces,\nThat she graces,\nThe smiling faces,\nMakes it all worthwhile.\n\nThe sky’s her ceiling,\nShe believes in,\nGives her a feeling,\nShe’s full of life.\n\nPeople walking to and fro,\nAlways notice flowers grow,\nFrom the seeds that she did sow,\nThis park so pleasing on the eye.\n\nSo find some time,\nTo stop and chat,\nTo this lovely lady,\nIn a gardener’s hat.\n\nOn a bench,\nWhere we sat,\nWe put the world right,\nIn seconds flat.\n\nNow what d’ya think,\nOf all of that?\nBlooming Mary,\nIn a gardener’s hat!
