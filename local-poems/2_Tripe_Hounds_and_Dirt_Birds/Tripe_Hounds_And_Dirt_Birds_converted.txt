Tripe hounds and dirt birds,\nHang fire just for fun,\nStroll around in shadows,\nAway from the glaring sun.\n\nWaiting for their victims,\nTo pick off one by one,\nBody language experts,\nStealth is second to none.\n\nPockets picked in real time,\nDistracted by a scene,\nCat fight in worn red heels,\nA wallet feeling lean.\n\nThree card tricks a plenty,\nOn dirty urban streets,\nPerfume sold off cheaply,\nWill burn holes in your sheets.\n\nCafés, pubs and hotels,\nBreeding ground of crime,\nDrop your guard for a minute,\nYou’ll be fleeced within that time.\n\nModern day Fagins,\nTeach their children how to steal,\nThey grow up crooked quickly,\nNever go without a meal.\n\n	The caring, sharing call girl,\nAgile in her moves,\nFingers slide on a passport,\nThe inner thigh she soothes.\n\nLong blade in a raincoat,\nA statement of intent,\nDon’t mess with a mean tinker,\nHe’s the curse end of a gent.\n\nTread lightly through the backstreets,\nStay close to the dimming light,\nDon’t ask someone for directions,\nYou’ll end up in a fight.\n\nThose tripe hounds and dirt birds,\nLive from day to day,\nNo street cred on your CV,\nYou’ll pay and pay and pay!
