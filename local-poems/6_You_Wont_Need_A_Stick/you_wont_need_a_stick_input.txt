Well, we take our bodies for granted,
A dangerous thing to do,
Muscles can stiffen in an instant,
That phrase is so very true.

So, treat your body like a temple,
A palace, or stately home,
Keep all your moving parts well oiled,
Don’t sit still like a garden gnome.

Luxurious deep body rubs,
In a massage parlour deluxe,
Will keep your body finely tuned,
As the masseuse instructs.

You won’t need to use a walking stick,
In your latter years,
A massage at least once a week,
Should be enough to do the trick.

Your back will be so supple,
You’ll never hear it click,
And with that spring in your step,
You’ll be very rarely sick!
