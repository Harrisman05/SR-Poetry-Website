Well, we take our bodies for granted,\nA dangerous thing to do,\nMuscles can stiffen in an instant,\nThat phrase is so very true.\n\nSo, treat your body like a temple,\nA palace, or stately home,\nKeep all your moving parts well oiled,\nDon’t sit still like a garden gnome.\n\nLuxurious deep body rubs,\nIn a massage parlour deluxe,\nWill keep your body finely tuned,\nAs the masseuse instructs.\n\nYou won’t need to use a walking stick,\nIn your latter years,\nA massage at least once a week,\nShould be enough to do the trick.\n\nYour back will be so supple,\nYou’ll never hear it click,\nAnd with that spring in your step,\nYou’ll be very rarely sick!\n
