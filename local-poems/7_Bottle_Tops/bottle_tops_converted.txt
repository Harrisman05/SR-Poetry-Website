What gives you satisfaction,\nWhat puts your world to rights,\nMine is very simple,\nI kick a bottle top with all my might.\n\nCan’t resist that full leg swing,\nLaunching that mini disc,\nFoot connecting perfectly,\nOn a logo image on tin.\n\nSometimes one kick is all it takes,\nSometimes two or three,\nMy record stands at seven,\nTo be beaten in due course by me.\n\nKicking a bottle top up the road,\nHas stayed with me all my life,\nCan’t resist even rusty ones,\nThat have been left to erode.\n\nThe twists and turns,\nDips and whirls,\nWhile spinning through the air,\nAn unmanned flying saucer,\nGoing who knows where.\n\nDipping left and curving right,\nBounces off a wall or tree,\nFinds a lamppost on its way,\nSometimes a stranger’s knee.\n\n	A hard landing coming soon,\nCrash landing upside down,\nThere it will stay motionless,\nOn a level ground.\n\nFunny how a simple thing,\nCan make me feel content,\nAfter kicking a bottle top up the road,\nWalking briskly with a grin.\n\nI spot one by a rubbish bin,\nMy foot contacts, it begins to spin,\nIf I make eight kicks,\nMy new record is in.\n\nBottle tops are a win, win, win…
